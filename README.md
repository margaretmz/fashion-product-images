# Fashion Product Images

Explore the Kaggle Fashion Product Images datasets: [small](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small) & [high res](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset) for computer vision tasks.

For now there are just two Colab notebooks:
* [Data Analysis](https://github.com/margaretmz/fashion-product-images/blob/main/0_Fashion_Product_Images_(Small)_Data.ipynb)
* [Classifier on fashion sub category](https://github.com/margaretmz/fashion-product-images/blob/main/1_Fashion_Product_Images_(Small)_Classifier.ipynb)

Over time I will be adding more tutorials using the fashion product images. 

## Installation
I use Colab notebook which comes with the following pre-installed:

* Python 3.7.10
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow 2.5.0 which includes Keras
